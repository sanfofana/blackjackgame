# black Black Game
Winter 2018 C++ Class

The Blackjack program needs to have the following:

One Computer controlled dealer
The choice of a single player or two players (at a minimum) and a dealer
The player(s) need(s) to be able to select the number of decks used. A minimum choice of a single deck or a double deck.
The decks have to be realistic (correct number of cards and correct number of each card)

The program will require a random number generator
Use a Vector for the decks (It'll make your life easier)
The dealer has a very specific limitation that will make your life easier (no need for a complex AI)
Let me know if you need help with the rules of the game
